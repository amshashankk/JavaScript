### In JS form validation there are some things that need to be corrected such as Future date view in calendar gets off and after form submit the form gets reset and the color of the form do not look green. Also turn off the State view when form gets submitted cause after submit without selecting country state cannot be shown to the user.


### In Jquery form validation ther is only one thing that is needed to be corrected which is current date view and future date view is disabled.
